        I started studying on my own out of pure curiosity, and since then,
        I&apos;ve been captivated by the world of programming. I love that
        it&apos;s a constantly evolving field, which motivates me to keep
        growing and developing as a professional. Currently, I&apos;m pursuing a
        degree in Computer Programming at UNSAM. Take a look around!
